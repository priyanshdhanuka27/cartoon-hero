		<!-- Characteristics -->
		<h2>Olaf's Characteristics</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Sprung from Elsa's magical powers, Olaf is by far the friendliest snowman to walk the mountains above Arendelle</li>
			<li> His innocence, outgoing personality and uncanny ability to disassemble himself at good and not-so-good times lead to some awkward, albeit laughable moments</li>
			<li>He is innocent, outgoing and loves all things summer</li>
			<li>Olaf may be a bit naive, but his sincerity and good-natured temperament make him a true friend to Anna and Elsa.</li>
			<li>He <b>LOVES</b> warm hugs!</li>
		</ol>
